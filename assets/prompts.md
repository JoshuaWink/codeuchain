This file contains ready-to-paste prompts for AI image generation. Each entry includes size, a concise prompt, negative prompts, and helpful notes (palette and style keywords are at the end).

1) Hero banner — README header
- Size: 1200×240
- Prompt: "Wide hero banner for a playful developer tool called 'Code‑U‑Chain' — minimal dark tech background, subtle circuit/chain motif weaving left→right, center-left bold typographic mark reading 'Code‑U‑Chain' with small subtext 'codeuchain' in monospace, glowing cyan + warm orange accent streaks, flat modern vector feel, soft vignette, high-res."
- Negative: "no watermark, no photo people, avoid busy textures, no realistic faces."
- Notes: leave safe space center-right for README overlay text.

2) Social preview / Open Graph
- Size: 1200×630
- Prompt: "Social preview image for Code‑U‑Chain: bold, friendly tech illustration showing linked code blocks forming a stylized 'U' chain, clean geometric shapes, high-contrast navy background, bright teal and coral accents, left side text area with 'Code‑U‑Chain' (large) and 'codeuchain' (small), modern flat vector, crisp edges."
- Negative: "no logos besides the generated mark, avoid watermarks and small illegible text."

3) Primary logo / mark (square)
- Size: 512×512 (or scalable SVG)
- Prompt: "Square logo mark for 'Code‑U‑Chain' — combine a stylized chain link and a <> code bracket, simplified geometric icon, single-color primary (teal) with orange accent, strong silhouette for favicons and stamps, flat vector, no text in icon (text handled separately)."
- Negative: "no gradient noise, no photo-realism."

4) Favicon
- Size: 64×64
- Prompt: "Tiny favicon: simplified element from the primary mark (one chain-link inside a rounded square) in teal on dark background, extreme clarity and contrast, no text."
- Negative: "no fine details that disappear at small sizes."

5) Compact banner / header (compact)
- Size: 600×120
- Prompt: "Compact banner for README top: condensed version of hero design, dark background, single horizontal chain motif, small 'Code‑U‑Chain' wordmark on left, subtle glow accent, clean and minimal."
- Negative: "no crowded elements."

6) Background texture (tileable)
- Size: 1920×1080 (tileable pattern)
- Prompt: "Subtle tileable background texture for docs: dark navy base with faint repeating schematic lines and small dot-matrix nodes, low-contrast, seam-free, no text, used behind content panels."
- Negative: "no high-contrast or distracting patterns."

7) Sticker / badge artwork (round)
- Size: 1000×1000 (circular)
- Prompt: "Round sticker design: playful, friendly robot librarian holding a chain of code blocks (tiny <> icons), prominent round border with 'Code‑U‑Chain' curved around top, teal + coral palette, slightly cartoonish but modern, vector style suitable for print."
- Negative: "no complex shading; avoid photo elements."

8) UI mock screenshot placeholder
- Size: 1400×900
- Prompt: "Stylized app mock: dark IDE-like window showing a pipeline view (blocks connected by arrows labeled 'lint', 'test', 'deploy'), right pane shows context metadata 'vscode:workspace', small floating 'Agent' badge, clean UI, subtle neumorphism, use brand colors, nothing real or proprietary."
- Negative: "no real code from proprietary repos, avoid readable secrets/credentials."
